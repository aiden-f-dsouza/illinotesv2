Today marks an exciting milestone for the UIUC community. We're officially launching **Illinotes** - a platform built by students, for students.

## The Problem We Solved

If you've ever tried to find notes for a missed lecture, you know the struggle:

- Scrolling through endless GroupMe messages
- Asking in class Facebook groups with no response
- Searching Google Drive folders with inconsistent naming

We built Illinotes to solve this problem once and for all.

## How It Works

1. **Sign up** with your email
2. **Upload notes** organized by course (CS124, MATH241, etc.)
3. **Search and filter** to find exactly what you need
4. **Engage** with likes, comments, and @mentions

## AI-Powered Summaries

Our built-in AI summarizer helps you digest lengthy lecture notes in seconds. Just paste your notes and get a clear, organized summary with key concepts highlighted.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're working on:

- Mobile app (coming Spring 2026)
- Professor verification badges
- Study group formation tools
- Integration with Canvas
