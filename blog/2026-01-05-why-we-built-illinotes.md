Every great product starts with a problem.

## The Moment of Frustration

Picture this: It's 11 PM, your MATH 241 midterm is in 10 hours, and you missed the lecture on Green's Theorem because you were sick. You:

1. Search the class GroupMe - nothing
2. Post asking for notes - no response
3. Check the shared Google Drive - 47 files with names like "notes_final_v2_REAL.pdf"
4. Give up and watch a YouTube video that covers different material

Sound familiar?

## The Spark of an Idea

After that frustrating night, we asked ourselves: **Why isn't there a simple, organized place for UIUC students to share notes?**

We had Discord, GroupMe, Google Drive, and a dozen other tools - but nothing designed specifically for sharing academic notes by course.

## What We Wanted

- **Organization** - Notes sorted by class, not buried in chat logs
- **Search** - Find exactly what you need instantly
- **Community** - Connect with classmates, not just download files
- **Simplicity** - No learning curve, just post and find notes

## The Building Process

We spent nights and weekends coding, designing, and testing. We talked to dozens of UIUC students about what they needed. We iterated based on feedback.

And now, we're ready to share it with you.

## Our Promise

Illinotes will always be:

- **Free** - No premium tiers, no paywalls
- **Student-focused** - Built for how you actually study
- **Privacy-respecting** - Your data is yours

## Thank You

Thank you for being part of this journey. Whether you're here to share notes, find notes, or just explore - we're glad you're here.
