DEMO VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

The landing page expects a demo video file at: static/demo-video.mp4

To add your demo video:
1. Record a short demo video (recommended: 1-2 minutes, 1920x1080 resolution)
2. Convert to MP4 format
3. Place the file in the static/ folder with the name: demo-video.mp4

Alternative:
- You can use any MP4 video file for placeholder purposes
- The video will autoplay, loop, and be muted by default
- The video is responsive and will maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio

If no video file is present, the video element will show a broken video indicator.
You can temporarily comment out the video section in templates/landing.html if needed.
